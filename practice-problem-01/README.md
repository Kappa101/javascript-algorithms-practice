## MEMOIZATION TECHNIQUE

There are always TradeOffs within Space-complexity and Time-complexity

whenever there are operation intensive functions [when it takes lotta time for function to compute and return a result] , THEN MEMOIZATION TECHNIQUE IS REALLY USEFUL

MEMOIZATION will cache a function
base level caching is adding some cacheable properties [the value of those function return] into a empty object
